# React Portfolio Lab


We're here for a reason, and that reason certainly ain't hearing Jeremy's lame dad jokes

We're here to enter the world of professional software engineering and coding. There are a few things that we will need to enter the field: A resume, a LinkedIn, and of course, a solid Portfolio site. 

We are going to spend the next block working in conjunction with Outcomes to help build up our portfolio sites.

This is *not* something you are going to finish up in 90 minutes. In fact, it something that you are going to continue working on and updating even after you deploy it online.

Take your time to plan out some wireframes and think of how you want to style your site


### Requirements

There is no standard way to build up a Portfolio, but we'd *highly* recommend having components for a Nav bar to get around the site, an About Me, which may or may not be your landing page, a component for your Resume, a Contact page, one to hold your Projects in, and a component for each project (You can add more as you build more of course!)
